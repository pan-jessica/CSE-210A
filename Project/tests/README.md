# Tests

These are the test scripts I ran on the python code of my project (both postfix and lark versions).\\
The tests were taken from the scripts we had to test our first homework assignment, ARITH. 
I've modified the test scripts to test for all operations listed below:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Parentheses
