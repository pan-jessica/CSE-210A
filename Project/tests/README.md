# Tests

These are the test scripts I ran on the python code of my project (both postfix and lark versions).  
The tests were taken from the scripts we had to test our first homework assignment, ARITH. 
I've modified the test scripts to test for all operations listed below:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Parentheses

In order to run these test scripts on the python code,
1. Move the python file you want to test into this directory
2. Check if you have pyinstaller installed
3. Check if you have lark-parser installed
4. Run `./test.sh`
